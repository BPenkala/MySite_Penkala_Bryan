	    	<h3>Profile</h3>
	    	<p class="profile">Standing at 6 feet 3 inches (1.91 m), Rose is a point 
	    	guard. Rose has established himself as an elite athlete who is extremely 
	    	strong and fast. He constantly attacks the basket and finishes in traffic 
	    	which contributes to his 
	    	career average of 21 points per game. Rose is known for is ability to convert 
	    	difficult layups. Rose's excellent body control and the ability to change 
	    	direction extremely well contribute to his ability to get to the rim. Rose is 
	    	at his best in the full court set because of his athleticism. He can initiate 
	    	the pick and roll at an elite level, contributing to his career average of 6.8 
	    	assists per game. Throughout his first two seasons the main weakness cited in 	
	    	Rose's ability was his three point range; he averaged only .242 on three point 
	    	field goals throughout his first two seasons. Rose greatly improved his three 
	    	point range in his third season (his MVP season). He averaged .332 on three 
	    	point field goals and made 128 three pointers in that season alone.
