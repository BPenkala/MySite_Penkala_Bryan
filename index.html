	    <p>Standing at 6 feet 3 inches (1.91 m), Rose is a point guard. Rose has 
	    established himself as an elite athlete who is extremely strong and fast. He 
	    constantly attacks the basket and finishes in traffic which contributes to his 
	    career average of 21 points per game. Rose is known for is ability to convert 
	    difficult layups. Rose's excellent body control and the ability to change 
	    direction extremely well contribute to his ability to get to the rim. Rose is 
	    at his best in the full court set because of his athleticism. He can initiate the 
	    pick and roll at an elite level, contributing to his career average of 6.8 assists 
	    per game. Throughout his first two seasons the main weakness cited in Rose's 
	    ability was his three point range; he averaged only .242 on three point field 
	    goals throughout his first two seasons. Rose greatly improved his three 
	    point range in his third season (his MVP season). He averaged .332 on three point 
	    field goals and made 128 three pointers in that season alone.
